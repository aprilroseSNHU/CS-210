# CS-210

This project takes a database of purchased items from a grocery store and displays the quantities in either numeric or visual form.
I feel that I did well on the visual display. The display that shows the number of items looks clean and is easy to interpret.
I could include more comments and explinations in my code to make it easier to review and for others to interpret. 
Creating the output that showed how many items were purchased with * was difficult, and I'm sure there was a better way that I could have done it. 
Creating a menu is a great skill to have in any language. It's the main way users will be interacting with your code. 
I included in line comments and tried to keep the code as simple as possible.
